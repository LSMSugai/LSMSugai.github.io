And thanks for visiting my website!

I'm an ecologist interested in the phenomena of acoustic communication in ecological communities. I use bioacoustics to address behavioral facets of species and to investigate causes and consequences of species interactions at multiple spatial and temporal scales.

I'm currently a Postdoctoral fellow working with acoustic monitoring of amphibians in Brazil, a project funded by the [Comunidad de Madrid] (https://gestiona3.madrid.org/quadrivium/convocatorias/), [Ministerio de Econom√≠a y Competitividad (MINECO, Spain)](https://www.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/mineco/?lang_choosen=en), and [EECBio/INCT - CNPq](https://www.eecbio.ufg.br/).
