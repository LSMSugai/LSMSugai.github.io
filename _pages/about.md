And thanks for visiting my website!

I'm an ecologist investigating biodiversity change at multiple spatial and temporal scales. I'm interested in using remote sensing technologies to assess ecological communities. Particularly, I have been using acoustic monitoring to describe assemblages through space and time and to address the causes and consequences of species interactions with the perspective of acoustic activity.

I'm currently a Postdoctoral fellow working with acoustic monitoring of amphibians in Brazil, a project funded by the [Comunidad de Madrid](https://gestiona3.madrid.org/quadrivium/convocatorias/), [Ministerio de Econom√≠a y Competitividad (MINECO, Spain)](https://www.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/mineco/?lang_choosen=en), and [EECBio/INCT - CNPq](https://www.eecbio.ufg.br/).
