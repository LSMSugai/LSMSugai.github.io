And thanks for visiting my website!

I'm an ecologist investigating biodiversity change at multiple spatial and temporal scales. I'm interested in using remote sensing technologies to assess ecological communities. Particularly, I have been using acoustic monitoring to describe assemblages through space and time and to address the causes and consequences of species interactions with the perspective of acoustic activity.

I'm an Extension Associate at the [K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell University] (https://www.birds.cornell.edu/ccb/).
